<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am a 20 year old Journalism, Publishing and Media student at Oxford Brookes. I also work for the charity Mencap, working with people with disabilities, and I am an editorial assistant for the Hydrogeology Journal. I have a brother who lives in Cambridge, working as a radio technician.</p>

<h2>What do I Like?</h2>
<p>I love reading, writing, singing, dancing and watching movies. My favourite genre is fantasy, and my favourite book is the Odyssey, because I have always loved classics. I don't have a favourite song, but I love musicals, especially Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen.</p>

<h2>Where do I come from?</h2>
<p>I currently live in Oxford for my studies, but I grew up not too far away in Henley-on-Thames, a town famous for the Henley Royal Regatta. My family recently moved house, and now live in Wallingford.</p>

<h2>My aspirations</h2>
<p>When I was younger, I wanted to be a vet, but I am allergic to cats, so I had to change my dreams. As I got older, I developed a love of writing. Inspired by my mum, who works as a technical editor for the Hydrogeology Journal, I got a part time job as an editorial assistant and loved it. I now aspire to be a fiction book editor.</p>
