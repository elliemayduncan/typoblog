Everyone knows Coca Cola, right? Whether you love it or hate it, you’re going to know what it is. But why is that? While a large part of it is the way it is marketed, the actual logo has its own unique reason as to why people are able to identify it on sight.

The iconic Coca Cola red was actually devised as an identifying colour over 120 years ago, to show tax agents that it was different from alcohol. The company’s official colour is comprised of 3 different shades of red, giving it an easy-to-spot individuality.

The logo itself was created by Frank Mason Robinson in 1885, and the font is called ‘Spencerian Script’. It is italicised and uses lots of swirly serifs, creating a handwritten effect. The two main ‘C’s in particular are very individualised, one creating an underline, and the other making a loop and passing through the ‘L’.

It is a relatively simple design, but this works in its favour. By using a fancy font that is also easy to read, eye-catching colours and exaggerating these simple aspects in their marketing, the product becomes easily recognisable.

This also applies to their other drinks, such as Diet Coke and Coke Zero. They use the iconic Coca Cola red, while also implementing their own styles. For example, Diet Coke associates with silver, and Coke Zero associates with black.

Ultimately, the widespread trust in Coca Cola helps to sell itself, but if easily seen on the shelves, that can’t hurt, right?
