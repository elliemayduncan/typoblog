You wouldn’t think that something as basic and commonplace as baked bean tins have any thought put into them. In reality, depending on country, brand and time period, baked bean tin wrappers have a broad spectrum, including font, colour and general design.

The most popular baked bean brand in the UK has to be Heinz (pun intended). The iconic turquoise colour of the brand is bound to catch the eye of anyone in the supermarket, and its capitalised, sans-serif font is easily recognisable.

Supermarket brands, such as Sainsburys and Aldi, in particular try to copy this model, in an attempt to gain an association between their beans and Heinz beans in the sub-consciousness of the public. However, this is not always the case, as more upper-class supermarkets, such as Waitrose, have been known to use serifs.

However, in other cultures, the Heinz model may differ. In Germanic countries (including Austria and Switzerland), the font of Heinz Baked Beans, although capitalised, uses serifs. This could indicate that Germanic countries have different cultural values to their British counterpart.

Target audience is another key factor in typography. For example, when the company ‘Whole Earth’ produced a baked bean product, their design was completely different from the typical turquoises, blues, reds and whites associated with baked beans.

Whole Earth, as indicated by the name, is a health-conscious, organic company, and their product designs reflect as such. Their colour selection is earthy oranges and creamy yellows, and their font has a faint serif, almost unperceivable at first glance, giving an impression that the brand is approachable, but also of value.

In truth, this concept of typography can be applied to any product, if you look hard enough. Have a go, spot the differences between your favourite brands. Could be fun.
